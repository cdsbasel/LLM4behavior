## Training Course

If you are a :hatching_chick: regarding LLMs, you may benefit from an intro course to learn about central concepts related to LLM and and get some hands-on experience! 

The first day will include an optional ** training session**, including a set of hands-on exercises.  

More information about course contents will be made available soon.
