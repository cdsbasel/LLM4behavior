## Training Course

If you are a :hatching_chick: regarding LLMs, you may benefit from an intro course to learn about central concepts related to LLM and get some hands-on experience with such models! 

The first day will include an optional **training session**, including a set of hands-on exercises for all interested workshop participants.

More information about course contents will be made available soon.
